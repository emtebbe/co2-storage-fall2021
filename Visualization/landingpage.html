<h1>Our Climate Action Mission is to Enable Rapid Carbon Sequestration Projects Using Data Science</h1>
<ul>
<li><h3>Match CO2 emitters to depleted oilfields to identify optimal storage projects using data science</h3></li>
<li><h3>Allow California EPA to find an affordable path toward net-zero emissions</h3></li>
<li><h3>With the extra benefit of redeploying oilfield workers in the CCS industry</h3></li>
</ul>
<br><br>
<p>Our team of UC Berkeley data scientists is looking at carbon recapture, putting emissions back into the ground. It is essential to every net-zero climate strategy. But existing plans for state-wide pipelines are too slow.
<p>California already has widespread depleted oil fields where you could sequester carbon safely.
<p>We seek to support regulators to help them optimize this capture immediately, building on existing regulations.
<p>We'd love your perspective on this, and to know what is possible in California. Please explore the scenarios on our dashboard to understand the tax credit incentives required for short- or long-term projects storing industrial emissions within depleted oil fields.
