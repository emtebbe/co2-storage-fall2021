    <h3 class="question">Why are you Optimizing Storage of Carbon Dioxide in California?</h3>
    <p>The project team has considered statewide CCS plans (actually Carbon Transport and Storage plans) such as described by Princeton (October 2021) to be too slow. The opportunity for the US to demonstrate leadership in the associated clean energy technologies would be left behind. We explore readier solutions, using tanker trucks and depleted oilfields, to see what can be done competitively today.</p>
    <br>

    <h3 class="question">How does optimization of the carbon dioxide problem translate into carbon dioxide solutions?</h3>
    <p>The tool is intended for use by regulators. Regulators set incentives as well as approve storage wells in depleted fields; support vehicle shipment practices; and can mandate carbon capture at a sustainable level.</p>
    <br>

    <h3 class="question">Can you help me with all the jargon?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Carbon Removal</b>: Elon Musk and others use this term to describe carbon capture from the air or the oceans. Includes <b>Direct Air Capture (DAC)</b> and <b>BioEnergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECSS)</b>. BioEnergy does not involve fossil fuels, and sequesters carbon in its biomass, such as algae and forests. See the <a href=https://www.xprize.org/prizes/elonmusk>XPRIZE website</a> where a dozen concepts were underway at time of writing this. Elon seeks to bring new technologies in this space up to commercial scale (kilotons) by 2025, and then massive scale.</li>
        <li><b>Carbon Capture and Storage(CCS)</b>: Technically, this implies up to three steps: Capture, Transport and Storage. Transport may be optional if Capture and Storage are in the same place. The term CCS is often linked to projects that only Capture, or only Transport and Storage. Indeed, our project is only Transport and Storage, as is the huge "CCS" project (Princeton, 2021) that we use to compare our rapid timeline. This inevitably leads to confusion. Keep an eye out for all three elements of a CCS project and when something is missing, question it! We prefer the term "<b>Carbon Storage</b>" projects (includes transport) even if it doesn’t sound as heroic (<i>"Capture him!!"</i>).</li>
        <li><b>Sequestration</b>: Very, very long-term storage. Also called "Storage".</li>
        <li><b>Pool</b>: Often called a "reservoir", this represents a space underground that contains, or used to contain, hydrocarbons (oil and/or gas). It is porous and permeable rock with a structure and a seal that has kept its hydrocarbons in place for millions of years (until humans harvested it). Multiple wells often intersect a single pool to speed up hydrocarbon extraction, especially as oil can be very viscous. We use a single CO<sub>2</sub> injection well for each pool, however where publicly reported data has failed to document distinct pools this may need to be revised working with the well operator(s).</li>
        <li><b>Fracked (or Fracced) Wells</b>: These are wells that would not flow oil or gas without explosions (fracturing). This process is rarely used in California. The fracturing creates a local "pool" around the well. Volumes from such wells are usually much less than from multi-well pools. The wells can be excluded from the modelling or left in and found to be suboptimal (too small to be efficient).</li>
        <li><b>Enhanced Oil Recovery(EOR)</b>: EOR can be achieved by injecting CO2 to reduce the viscosity of oil and pushing oil or gas towards other wells. EOR in California however is more often achieved through water injection or steam-flooding. If CO<sub>2</sub> is used, the gas rises up through liquids already in the filling the porous rock, and ultimately filling the pool structure. To complicate the jargon further, use of CO<sub>2</sub> for EOR (specifically) is called <b>CCUS</b> - Carbon Capture, Use and Storage. Some CO<sub>2</sub> escapes with the hydrocarbons during EOR, but a lot of it remains in the ground. It is not usually accepted as "CCS" (hence the different acronym) and the increased production of hydrocarbons is seen as potentially adding to the overall carbon dioxide problem. It does depend what happens to the hydrocarbons, but today it is likely to result in unsequestered emissions simply because CCS is very rare.</li>
        <li><b>Saline Aquifers</b>: Salty underground water reservoirs. In the context of CCS, this implies large pools of water at considerable depth. Carbon dioxide injected into such aquifers is assumed to be safely stored. The concept requires significant study, to ensure the aquifer is structurally sound (often assumed to be ‘very likely’) and that it will not impact drinkable ground water. The concept has been proven in some parts of the world on a small scale.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>

      <h3 class="question">What benchmark are you trying to exceed?</h3>
      <p>Few CCS plans exist for California. Projects like CaliCapture are CCUS, ie. EOR (in that case, for the Elk Hills field). This does sequester some (or most) of its injected carbon dioxide. Somewhat less than 1.46 million tonnes per year is significant. The net benefit (or otherwise) of CCUS needs to be agreed upon.</p>
      <p>The <b>"Net-Zero America"</b> published by Princeton University on 29 October 2021 documents a massive project that is primarily CCS, not CCUS. The project involves statewide pipelines, the alignment of many, many stakeholders, and storage of carbon dioxide in saline aquifers. At least 15 years is budgeted to align stakeholders, build massive pipelines, and study the aquifers. Our project seeks solutions that can be implemented much sooner - without need for pipelines or untested aquifers, and with a small focus group of stakeholders. This leads to solutions using trucks linking emitters to specific depleted oilfields.</p>
      <br>

      <h3 class="question">Are Tanker Trucks commonly used for CCS? How do you estimate cost?</h3>
      <p>Not all CCS projects involve transport. A recently completed coal powerplant in Canada stores 40% of its CO<sub>2</sub> underground. But when there is a transport element it usually involves a pipeline. Building a pipeline implies there is a long-term continuous source of CO<sub>2</sub>. Existing CCS projects are collectively quite small, far less than whole-industry scale. Scaling up to a whole industry, huge pipelines run the risk of becoming redundant with advances in cleaner energy and process technologies.</p>
      <p>Trucks are a concern for environmental justice stakeholders as diesel trucks produce particulate pollution. Electric vehicles are preferred and may be available in the next few years but they cannot be assumed immediately. Managing this concern may constrain final transport routes.</p>
      <p>The economy of trucks can be improved by combining with rail transport. Truck/train transport is estimated to half the cost of transport. Both truck and rail transport is calculated on the basis of a round trip - dual purpose transport would potentially reduce the overall cost. Transport costs are estimated at $4/mile, two-way.</p>
      <p>Route calculations are determined using lat/long great circle estimation. A future phase upgrading this tool is envisaged to use actual road and rail routes. Some train lines may be accessible only to freight. It will be important to check freight lines are included in any new route calculation solution.</p>
      <p>Truck shipment size is estimated at 25 tonnes of CO2 per tanker truck. Trucks have been proven in China in use for CCUS (that is, for enhanced oil recovery). Transfer to the wellhead is assumed to be possible, as truckloads have been successfully used in some CCS testing projects (a very costly test, since available carbon dioxide in these cases was food-grade).</p>
      <br>

      <h3 class="question">How do you account for the cost of injecting CO<sub>2</sub> into the ground?</h3>
      <p>The simulation assumes one active or idle well is converted into a suitable injector well. The cost of conversion was estimated at $2M based on a paper describing well costs of conversion of oil wells to "WAG" (water and gas) wells. Further refinement of well cost is possible; well cost is likely to also change over time where rig availability or economy of scale is involved.</p>
      <p>Abandoned pools are tagged in the data. All wells for an abandoned pool are required to be "plugged and abandoned", which means they have been sealed. Injecting into an abandoned pool requires a new well to be drilled, at a cost of $5M. Abandoned pools could use different well costs, however the benefits are significant – other wells are already cleaned up and the pool is no longer in use. As an initial use-case, the additional cost of drilling a new well into an abandoned field can be assumed to be covered separately under incentives. The cost will still need to be budgeted for.</p>
      <br>

      <h3 class="question">Where does the emissions data come from? Is it reliable?</h3>
      <p>Emissions data comes from the Federal EPA, a requirement of GHGR (greenhouse gas reporting). Reports date back to 2011. Initially estimates were allowed in some cases but now direct measurement of emissions output is required by law. Large (industrial) emitters are captured - if this project were to consider commercial or residential emissions then another dataset would be required.</p>
      <p>The emissions used in this project are process emissions - a direct result of the chemical processes involved in producing a product. Additional emissions are also tracked for fuel use at these facilities. To simplify assumptions about capture, we are only looking at the process emissions. Process emissions are much greater than other fuel emissions (at least ten times).</p>
      <br>

      <h3 class="question">Where does the production data come from?</h3>
      <p>This data is provided each year (since 1977) as monthly production values per well by the California Department of Conservation. We aggregate production to annual, then sum across all years for each well.</p>
      <p>Separate analysis of proprietary data identified that 80% of California's recorded production occurred since 1977. Some upside storage potential is expected in older fields but that data is not publicly available.</p>
      <p>Production is then aggregated by pool. Not all wells capture the pool, area and field name. Where field name is missing, the well (and its production) is excluded from the study. Wells are then aggregated into pools, or areas where only one pool is seen. This process is significantly hampered by data quality. For instance, Wikipedia indicates that the Midway-Sunset field (biggest field in California) has 22 pools. The dataset shows 7 pools, and most wells with no pool assigned. This leads to oversized pools which would require further data from field operators or hardcopy completion reports to resolve. After that, any missing well cost due to blending pools could be charged to operators providing incomplete data.</p>
      <br>

      <h3 class="question">What is "set-back" data?</h3>
      <p>California is currently considering a proposal to require new wells to be further than 1 kilometer (3,200 feet) from residences, prisons, daycare, elderly care, or health care facilities. FracTracker Alliance provided data for all wells within 2,500 feet of the human habitation categories for our project, with Governor Newsom announcing the 3,200 feet target too late to update our data. While the original intention was to prevent activity on such wells, it appears the legislation targets only new wells - although feedback from the public is being sought in December 2021. Other oil- and gas-producing states do have a regulated statewide setback buffer.</p>
      <p>Our project avoids use of wells within setback as injector wells. Very few pools only have set-back wells. The overall effect is minimal. A further option would be to exclude any pools with <i>any</i> setback wells but this would only be necessary if required by citizen stakeholders.</p>
      <br>

      <h3 class="question">How do you calculate carbon dioxide storage capacity?</h3>
      <p>There are no protocols for calculating carbon dioxide storage capacity in oil or gas fields however there are case studies. Most studies explore the potential of enhanced oil recovery (CCUS), often measuring capacity on the basis of existing recovery factor and potential for increased production. For gas there is a detailed study of the Goldeneye CCS project in the North Sea. The project has not been approved yet but the metrics are thorough.</p>
      <p>Ideally these calculations would take into account the pressure and temperature of the pool as that significantly changes the volume of carbon dioxide under pressure. Pool-level temperature data was not found in the public domain, although with some depth information the temperature might be estimated from a geothermal gradient. Pressure is subject to local conditions. Some pressure data is provided with wells. Depth data is provided only with some wells. The Goldeneye analysis showed that variations would be minor, hence a consistent scalar was used for the depleted gas volumes that permitted some room for error.</p>
      <p>Less information is provided about sequestration in depleted oil fields however tonnes of each of carbon dioxide and oil were interchangeable in one study. Oil fields typically produce only 25% of the oil present, with the remaining oil sticking to the porous rock. Enhanced oil recovery can increase this percentage somewhat. Remaining oil can also interact with the carbon dioxide, changing the volume potential. An estimate of half the oil mass was ultimately used.</p>
      <p>More detailed estimates would be likely to have mostly upside on the basis of volumetrics.</p>
      <br>

      <h3 class="question">What about the orphan wells?</h3>
      <p>Orphan wells are wells with no ownership. If a prior owner of the well can be identified no earlier than 1996 then that prior owner remains accountable for the well abandonment costs. Only 5,000 or so orphan wells have been identified. California Resource Corporation wells are often highlighted as potential liabilities due to the financial circumstances of that company, however Occidental Petroleum sold its California wells to CRC only in 2004, so would still be liable.</p>
      <p>Ultimately orphan wells were not incorporated in the optimization due to insufficient time to gather the data (digitizing maps from publications). However sequestration of carbon dioxide remains an opportunity to manage the state's cost of orphan well cleanup as part of CCS implementation.</p>
      <br>

      <h3 class="question">Do incentives already exist?</h3>
      <p>Yes. The tax credit for carbon sequestration (Section 45Q) applies to geologically sequestered carbon dioxide, as well as the same with enhanced oil recovery. For equipment placed in service since 2/9/2018, the credit is $31.77 per metric tonne CO<sub>2</sub> for CCS and $20.22 for EOR. These amounts increase to $50 and $35 by 2026 respectively, then become inflation adjusted. These incentives are argued by counter-proposals to be too low, with alternative suggestions of $90 and even $175 being floated. This is perhaps the most pressing issue for regulators to solve.</p>
      <br>

      <h3 class="question">What about monitoring of injected pools?</h3>
      <p>Good question. Monitoring is the key difference between a Class II well (intended for CCUS) and a Class VI well (intended for CCS). Some monitoring is implied in oilfield decommissioning economics. This would need to be compared with Class VI requirements to understand if there is a further cost differential to be added, and whether this would scale with pool size or injector wells. An observation well is likely to be needed which will not exist in abandoned fields. This additional sophistication will depend on regulatory changes proposed to allow Class II sequestration wells.</p>
      <br>

      <h3 class="question">How do you say, "CaliCO2"?</h3>
      <p>It is a portmanteau of <b>Cali</b>fornian <b>CO<sub>2</sub></b>. We like to pronounce it as "calico-two". Like some kind of digital cat.</p>
