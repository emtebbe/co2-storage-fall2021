Table 1
1. What data are included in this file?,,,,
,,,,
"Facilities report emissions from many process types defined by the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP). Reporting requirements for each process type are contained in different subparts of the regulation (40 CFR 98). This file contains more detailed data on emissions from fuel combustion than you can find in the GHGRP's Facility Level Information on Greenhouse gases Tool (FLIGHT). For the purposes of this file, fuel combustion emissions are defined as those reported under Pulp and Paper Manufacturing (Subpart AA), Electricity Generation (Subpart D), and General Stationary Fuel Combustion (Subpart C), except that Subpart C emissions do not include emissions from the use of sorbent. Emissions values presented by fuel type are not directly reported to EPA by facilities in all cases. Some values have been estimated by EPA based on publicly available reported data.",,,,
,,,,
2. What is a Facility ID?,,,,
,,,,
This is a unique identification number that has been given to each facility subject to the GHGRP. The identification number can be used to track a facility's emissions totals from one year to the next should the facility's name or address change.,,,,
,,,,
3. What is an FRS ID?,,,,
,,,,
"A FRS ID (Facility Registry System Identification Number) is a facility identification number. The Facility Registry System is a centrally managed EPA database that identifies facilities, sites or places subject to environmental regulations or of environmental interest across various EPA programs.",,,,
,,,,
4. What is a NAICS Code?,,,,
,,,,
"NAICS code stands for the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code. It is a six-digit code that represents the product, activity, or service at a facility or supplier. The codes are listed in the Federal Register and defined in “North American Industrial Classification System Manual 2007,” available from the U.S. Department of Commerce here:",,,,

5. How are biogenic CO2 emissions accounted for in facility totals?,,,,
,,,,
"Facilities that burn biomass fuels such as wood are required to report biogenic CO2 emissions associated with the combustion of those fuels. This file contains the total biogenic CO2 emissions reported by each facility at the unit level. Biogenic emissions are NOT included in the facility's total emissions. Biogenic emissions were most commonly reported by electricity generation units, pulp and paper mills, landfills and other faciliites combusting large amounts of biomass.",,,,
,,,,
6. How are biogenic CO2 emissions presented?,,,,
,,,,
"Biogenic CO2 emissions presented on the UNIT_DATA tab are from either subpart C or subpart D combustion sources.  Subpart AA reports biogenic CO2 at the subpart rather than unit level, so unit level biogenic CO2 emissions from subpart AA combustion sources are represented as null values.

On the FUEL_DATA tab, biomass fuels have non-biogenic CO2 values of zero.",,,,
,,,,
"7. What information is available through EnviroFacts, FLIGHT, the Data Highlights Website and the downloadable data files? ",,,,
,,,,
EPA has several data portals through which the public can access data collected by the GHGRP. A description of each portal including the types of queries that can be performed using each one is available here:,,,,
https://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting/ghg-reporting-program-data-sets,,,,
,,,,
8. What are the global warming potentials (GWPs) used in publication of GHGRP data?,,,,
,,,,
"Effective reporting year 2013, the GHGRP updated many of the GWP values used to calculate reporters’ emissions in carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e). These GWP values were updated from values provided in Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) Second Assessment Report (SAR) to those in the Fourth Assessment Report (AR-4). See 40 CFR 98 Table A-1 for the complete list of gases and their updated GWPs. To present a consistent time-series, EPA has provided re-calculated prior year GHG totals, which were calculated using SAR values, using the revised AR4 GWP values. The raw data submitted by facilities for reporting years prior to 2013 remains as submitted using SAR GWPs.",,,,
